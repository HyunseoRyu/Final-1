            Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American
            communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, in the late
            19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues">blues</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime">ragtime</a>. Since
            the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of
            musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the
            common bonds of African-American and European-American musical
            parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex
            chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.
            Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.

            A film score is original music written specifically to accompany a
            film. The score comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or
            choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at
            specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic
            narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores
            are written by one or more composers under the guidance of, or in
            collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then
            usually performed by an ensemble of musicians – most often
            comprising an orchestra (most likely a symphony orchestra) or band,
            instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists – known as playback
            singers and recorded by a sound engineer.

          <p>
            Classical music generally refers to the formal musical tradition of
            the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music
            or popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as
            Western classical music, as the term "classical music" may also
            refer to non-Western traditions which exhibit similar formal
            qualities. In addition to formality, classical music is often
            characterized by complexity in its musical form and harmonic
            organization, particularly with the use of polyphony. Since at least
            the 9th-century it has been primarily a written tradition, spawning
            a sophisticated notational system, as well as accompanying
            literature in analytical, critical, historiographical, musicological
            and philosophical practices. A foundational component of Western
            Culture, classical music is frequently seen from the perspective of
            individual or groups of composers, whose compositions, personalities
            and beliefs have fundamentally shaped its history.
